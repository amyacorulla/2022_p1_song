Tell me what you want, what you like it's okay
Im a little curious too
Tell me if im wrong if it's right I don't care
I can keep a secret can you?

Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind 
Got a taste for the cherry i just need to take a bite
Don't tell your mother
kiss one another
die for each other
We're cool for the summer 

Take me down into your paradise
Dont be scared cause im your body type 
Just something that we want to try 
Cause you and I We're cool for the summer
